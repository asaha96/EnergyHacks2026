## 2. Design Philosophy

### Visual Identity
- **Framework:** shadcn/ui with custom theme
- **Feel:** Snappy, minimal, data-driven, rich, clean, smooth, sleek, modern
- **Color Palette:** Earth tones meets tech (suggest: deep greens, warm neutrals, clean whites, accent gold/amber for energy)
- **Typography:** Clean sans-serif, high readability, generous whitespace
- **Animations:** Subtle, purposeful micro-interactions. Framer Motion for page transitions.
- **Maps:** Custom-styled Leaflet tiles that match the application aesthetic (consider Mapbox or custom tile styling)

### UX Principles
1. **Progressive Disclosure:** Only show what's needed at each step
2. **Immediate Feedback:** Every action has visual confirmation
3. **Spatial Consistency:** Map is the anchor; UI elements slide in/out around it
4. **Data Confidence:** Show sources, explain calculations, build trust

---

## 3. Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Framework | Next.js 14 (App Router) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui |
| Maps | React Leaflet + Leaflet Draw |
| State | Zustand (lightweight, perfect for map state) |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Auth | NextAuth.js (Email + Google) |
| Database | PostgreSQL with Prisma (for plans storage) |
